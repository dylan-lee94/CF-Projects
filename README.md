# MSC Computational Finance @ UCL

This repository is a collection of coding projects from my Master's at UCL. 

## COMP0050: Machine Learning with Applications in Finance
Projects: 
- Real-time financial crisis prediction based on macroeconomic indicators (time series); This supervised learning project included feature engineering, oversampling, feature selection and data cleaning
- Constructed a global minimum variance portfolio using different regularizers and sliding window validation to find optimal parameters
- Applied clustering techniques and PCA on daily equity return data to find meaningful interpretations of the clusters and eigenvectors
- 
## COMP0040: Financial Data and Statistics 
Projects:
- Investigated empirical probability distributions, tail behaviour and risk measures (VaR \& CVaR) of Cryptocurrencies for different time horizons
- Examined the time scaling properties, including stationarity, autocorrelation and generalized Hurst exponent
- Quantified the dependency between crypto assets returns the effect of textual sentiment by utilising Mutual Information and Correlation (linear \& non-linear).%; This includes the calculation of p-values (permutation test) and confidence intervals (bootstrapping)
## COMP0041: Applied Computational Finance
## COMP0043: Numerical Methods for Finance
Projects: 
- Pricing of vanilla and exotic options using the Binomial Model, Monte Carlo Methods, Fast Fourier Transforms and Black–Scholes–Merton Model. 

## COMP0045: Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes Learning with Applications in Finance
## COMP0048: Financial Engineering

## COMP0051: Algorithmic Trading
## COMP0075: Financial Market Modelling and Analysis
